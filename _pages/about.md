### Me

I'm 40-something and have a lovely wife and two young boys.  I live in South Louisiana in a small town and love chilling out with my family.  I also love internet of things and anything gadgety-electronic.

### Career

I have only recently gotten into the ***tester***/developer/coder/programmer part of my career.  I have been on the technical side of computers for 21+ years, then 4 months before my current role I started dedicating small parts of my day to learning code or anything related to coding, like documentation, blogs, twitter, etc.  I've always dabbled in code - scripting with VBScript, [AutoIt](https://autoitscript.com){:target="_blank"}, Python, JavaScript, etc. - but really started training myself and also looking at how companies interview developers, before landing my current job as a Test Engineer.  The "how companies interviewed developers" led me on a wild goose chase with lots of angry blog/twitter posts.  I didnâ€™t find the interviews too bad, but it could be the company I interviewed with and am working for, idk.  So, almost a year now (November 2020) and Iâ€™m really enjoying this test stuff ðŸ¤“.

### End...

Thatâ€™s all.  I look forward to blogging about software testing and all that goes along with it.
