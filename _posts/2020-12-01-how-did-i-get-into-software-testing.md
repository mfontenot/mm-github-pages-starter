My journey into a software tester role was a short one, but if I think back it was the longest path I have ever taken to get here.

### September 2019

I received an email from a recruiter at a local consulting company, asking if I would be interested in some openings they had (none of them were software testing).  I agreed to meet to understand what they were looking for.  Now, I had my resume with them for a few months and may have applied for positions but never received a call for anything that I applied to.  This was someone reaching out to me.  At the end of the month we talked.  I was very candid with them, letting them know that I did some software development but was not comfortable with applying for such positions due to my lack of skills this company would require.  They agreed and would get back to me since there was something coming up soon.

### October 2019

A full month from previous talks with the consulting company, I received an email with a position for Test Engineer.  I was ecstatic and nervous.  What was this role and would I be coding stuff?  I read the job role and got excited.  There was a lot of things I planned several months before this day arrived, like telling myself that I was a software developer, writing mini applications in JavaScript, and reading as many blogs as I could about how developers are interviewed.  We planned the interview with my soon-to-be Director and a Technical Manager.  It went great, I felt.  Almost a month to the day from the original contact and I had an interview!  Was I on my way?  Yep, I have an in-person interview on the 30th!

The in-person interview went fantastic.  They asked "coder interview" questions I researched but there was no HR person there.  That was different than any other interview I‚Äôve ever had.  Anyways...they asked about my experience and what I liked about the role and a few more things that I researched the day before üòé.  Then, the fun part...code challenges!  Now, a couple days before this I went through a JavaScript course that showed me how to do ‚Äúfizz buzz‚Äù, not thinking this would come up in my interview but I did read this may come up in a few blogs.  Here I was, at a wall that was also a dry erase board, in front of 2 Sr. Developers and a Test Engineer, about to write pseudo-code for ‚Äúfizz buzz‚Äù!  I wrote pseudo-code and went through an iteration or two to fix it with their help.  It was the greatest experience and nerve racking at the same time.

### November 2019

I start November 25th!  Woot!

I was anxious to hear if they liked me, if I passed their code tests, and would get hired for the position.  For 21ish years I had wanted to be a developer and this was what I‚Äôve looked forward to for a long time.  I had scripted stuff throughout my career as desktop support and wrote several mini-applications as the need arose in preparation for this.  Now, I may not be writing pure code but I write Java code as required for automated tests, and I get to review Java code and am learning from the Developers on my team.

I am a year into it, at the time of this post, and loving the company I work for and my teammates!
