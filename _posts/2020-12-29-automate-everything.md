excerpt: "When I was in a desktop support role, which was most of the past 21 years of my career, I found that automation was the “go to” if you wanted to keep away from touching something hundreds of times a day to get what you wanted. This could be automating the transfer of files from a computer to a FTP server or installation of software that asked too many questions. Whatever it was, it didn’t matter...automate it!"

When I was in a desktop support role, which was the past 21 years of my career, I found that automation was the “go to” if you wanted to keep away from touching something hundreds of times a day to get what you wanted. This could be automating the transfer of files from a computer to a FTP server or installation of software that asked too many questions. It didn't matter what it was…automate it!

Automation is something people want to do and I’m “all in”. But, as others have written, is it too much when it comes to software testing? Can you automate too much? I’m finding, yes it's too much. I’ve seen advocates for automation, which is fine and good, but watch out because you may get caught in an “automation hole” and not see the other side or know how to escape.

Back to my desktop support career and how that triggers my “automation friend” to question when someone says, “that needs to be manually tested, Mike.” Me (in my mind): “Say what?! 🤨 I can automate everything, why not this test?! We’ll see about that.” Then I go off into a corner, rethink the idea and come out several minutes later in defeat. Wow, they were right. I can’t and shouldn’t try to automate this one. We have countless other negative tests and adding this one does nothing but add one more test that (please pay attention to this next statement) we’ll have to maintain. Maintenance of the other tests we’ve written is somewhat haunting us at this point, not too much but it’s there…lurking. Now I find myself writing this blog post to solidify the idea in my head (and hope it sticks).

Others have written on this topic, and now I finally see what they were referring to. Almost all tests you should automate but don’t let that be the “everything”.
