In the past 2 or so months I have decided to enhance my Tester career instead of trying to become a Jr. Java Developer.  My mindset has changed now and I would rather be a better Tester.

### Why the switch? ###

You may be saying, why don't you want to be a Jr. Developer.  I'll say that it does appeal to me and has appealed to me ever since I made the [shift from technical to learning how to code](/about-me).  However...I have found, in my current role and company, that I can move around at almost any time a role becomes available as long as I can meet the requirements for the role and ace the interview process.  In the first couple of months I felt that I was just pressing a button to run automated tests and have decided that I should dive deeper into what a Tester/QA role should really look like.  This has opened up a world of treasures for me; one such that I will dedicate some time to it below and possibly some future posts with what I have learned from that resource.

I have already put some of the things into practice, by asking to be more involved in the user story writing process and pre-story writing processes.

### Ministroy of Testing (MoT - my #1 resource at the moment) ###

I found the [Ministry of Testing](https://www.ministryoftesting.com){:target="_blank"} site on one of my many web/twitter searches.  Almost immediately I signed up for the pro monthly subscription in order to take advantage of listening to their previous talks and learning resources (TestBash FTW!).  I loved the site and all of the resources available to me and can't say enough about it, but if you are a Tester/QA then you should probably get a pro subscription.
