In the past 2 months I have decided to enhance my Tester career instead of trying to become a Jr. Java Developer.  My mindset has changed now and I would like to become a better Tester.

### Why the switch? ###

You may be saying, why don't you want to be a Jr. Developer.  I'll say that it does appeal to me and has appealed to me ever since I made the [shift from technical to learning how to code](/about).  However...I have found, in my current role and company, that I can move around at almost any time a role becomes available as long as I can meet the requirements for the role and ace the interview process.  In the first couple months I felt that I was mindlessly pressing a button to run automated tests and have decided that I should dive deeper into what a Tester/QA role should look like.  This has opened a world of treasures for me; one thing is to dedicate more time to it along with future posts with what I have learned from others in this field and *Ministry of Testing*.

I've put a handful of things into practice, by asking to be more involved in the user story writing and pre-story processes.

### Ministry of Testing (MoT - my #1 resource at the moment) ###

I found the [Ministry of Testing](https://www.ministryoftesting.com){:target="_blank"} site on one of my many web/twitter searches.  Almost immediately I signed up for the pro subscription in order to take advantage of listening to their previous talks and learning resources (TestBash FTW!).  I loved the site and all the resources available to me and can't say enough about it, and if you're a Tester/QA then you should at least have a look.
